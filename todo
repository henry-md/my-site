Good to do
- add stuff to bottom: link to github, linkedin
- animate above the fold stuff like reference site
- animate featured projects to make them fade in (like your CheckItOut website)
- make "Hi, I'm Henry" change background gradients like reference
- hard code above the fold to be 100% of vh. Would involve coding padding of tabs in terms of vh, etc.
- make message increase in height as they type

Maybe later
- what I do section
  - consider printing emailers sideways and taking screenshot like that
